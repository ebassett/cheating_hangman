# Think Like a Programmer ex8.1
# PROBLEM: CHEATING AT HANGMAN
# Write a program that will be Player 1 in a text-based version of hangman (that is, you
# don't actually have to draw a hanged manâ€”just keep track of the number of incorrect
# guesses). Player 2 will set the difficulty of the game by specifying the length of the
# word to guess as well as the number of incorrect guesses that will lose the game.
# The twist is that the program will cheat. Rather than actually picking a word at
# the beginning of the game, the program may avoid picking a word, so long as when
# Player 2 loses, the program can display a word that matches all the information given
# to Player 2. The correctly guessed letters must appear in their correct positions, and
# none of the incorrectly guessed letters can appear in the word at all. When the game
# ends, Player 1 (the program) will tell Player 2 the word that was chosen. Therefore,
# Player 2 can never prove that the game is cheating; it's just that the likelihood of Player 2
# winning is small.
